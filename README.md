# CMSC204 Exercise 3: Graphs

Given two predefined graphs, the program allows the user to perform depth-first search or traversal, and breadth-first search or traversal.

## Implementation Status of Requirements

- [ ] The program displays a window with a menu of 5 items enumerated below.
- [ ] [1] Perform Depth First Traversal 
	- When the user chooses [1], the user is asked which graph he or she wants to traverse. The program then prints out the final order in which the nodes are visited using the Depth First Traversal. Traversal will always start from node A or 0.
- [ ] [2] Perform Breadth Fist Traversal 
	- When the user chooses [2], the user is asked which graph he or she wants to traverse. The program then prints out the final order in which the nodes are visited using the Breadth First Traversal. Traversal will always start from node A or 0.
- [ ] [3] Search Graph 1(DFS)
	- Choosing [3] searches for the vertex inputted by the user. Use the DFS on Graph 1 and print a message if the vertex is not part of the graph.
- [ ] [4] Search Graph 2(BFS)
	- Choosing [4] searches for the vertex inputted by the user. Use the BFS on Graph 2 and print a message if the vertex is not part of the graph.
- [ ] [5] Exit
	- Keep on displaying the menu until the user chooses [5].
- [ ] Implement the Graph data structure using either an adjaceny matrix or **adjacency list**. Author's note: I'm choosing to do the latter implementation.
