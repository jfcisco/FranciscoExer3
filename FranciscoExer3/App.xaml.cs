 * Description of the Program: 
 *      This application demonstrates the depth-first search and traversal,
 *      and the breadth-first search and traversal methods of the graph
 *      data structure. A graphical user interface is provided with options 
 *      to perform depth-first traversal and breadth-first traversal for
 *      one of the two predefined graphs, depth-first search for the first
 *      graph, and breadth-first search for the second graph.
